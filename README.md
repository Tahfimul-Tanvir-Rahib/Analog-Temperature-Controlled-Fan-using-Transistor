# Analog-Temperature-Controlled-Fan-using-Transistor
This project demonstrates a cost-effective analog temperature-controlled fan system without the use of any microcontroller or programming. It uses an LM35 temperature sensor to measure ambient temperature and a BC547 NPN transistor to switch a 5V DC fan on or off based on the sensed temperature
